        <h1>HTML Elements Showcase - Inline vs Block</h1>
        <p>Introduction: 
            In HTML, elements are broadly divided into 
            two categories: block-level and inline. 
            Block elements take up the full width, while 
            inline elements only take as much space as needed.</p>
